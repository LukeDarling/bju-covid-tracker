# BJU COVID Tracker

The goal of this project is to provide an easily accessible source of current and historic information to aid researchers and the general public.  To this end, the application ingests COVID data published by Bob Jones University, making it available as both an api and bulk download.  Additionally, the application serves a web dashboard that displays current information as well as showing trends through visualizations.
